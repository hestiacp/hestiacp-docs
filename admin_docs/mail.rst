Check first if the port 25 is open for outgoing traffic. A lot of providers close port 25 on default as a security measurement to combat spam.

Run the following command in commad line:

.. code-block:: bash

    telnet ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM 25
    
If the connection was successfull you will see:

.. code-block:: bash

    Trying 2a00:1450:400c:c00::1b...
    Connected to ASPMX.L.GOOGLE.COM.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    220 mx.google.com ESMTP a7si1253985wrr.455 - gsmtp
    
If not you have 2 options: 
    1. Contact you provider and ask them to open port 25 for outgoing traffic.
    2. Setup a mail relay under the mail domain settings or set it up generally for the server in system settings. For this you to use an SMTP relay service like:

.. image:: ../images/mail/mail.png
    :width: 600px
    :align: center
    :height: 321px
    :alt: DNS records

A record with name "mail" with content your server ip
A record with name "webmail" with the content of your server ip
MX record with name "mail" with content mail.domain.com
TXT record with name "@" with the content "v=spf1 a mx ip4:your ip; ~all"
TXT record with name "_domainkey" with content "t=y; o=~;"
TXT record with name "mail._domainkey" with content "t=y; o=~DKIM key;"

The DKIM key and SPF record can be found via: "Mail" -> When hovering the domain go to DNS records you will see an page with the required info

**********************************************************************************
If I send email from my server they end up in the spam folder?
**********************************************************************************

Make sure you have set up the correct RDNS, SFP records and DKIM records. DKIM and  SPF record can be found in "Mail" -> When hovering the domain go to DNS records

If this doesn't work it might be possible that you ip address is on one or more black lists. You can try to unblock your self or often the easier method is to use SMTP with Amazon SES or an other SMTP provider.
