Nginx FastCGI Cache
###############################################################

..note 

   FastCGI only applies for Nginx + PHP-FPM servers. If you use Nginx + Apache2 + PHP-FPM this will not apply to you!

FastCGI Cache is an option with in Nginx allowing to cache the out put off FastCGI (in this case php). There will be for a short moment a file created on your server with the contents of the output. If an other user requests the same page Nginx will check if the "age" of the cached file is still valid and if it is true it will send the cached file to to the user.

FastCGI cache works best for sites get a lot of request and the pages doesn't change that often. (For example a news site). For a more dynamic sites there might be changes required to the configuration or even disabling is required.

***************************************************************
Why does software package x and y not work with FastCGI cache
***************************************************************

As we have over 20 different templates and we don't use them al we have decided it to release the future and hope in the future the community helps improving the templates with a pull request. 

If you want to add support to a certain template you need to add the following lines to the template file(s)

Check the examples below. 
    
***************************************************************
How do I enable FastCGI cache for my custom template 
***************************************************************

Within the block where you call php / fastcgi pass 

.. code-block:: bash

    location ~ [^/]\.php(/|$) {
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        try_files $uri =404;
        fastcgi_pass    %backend_lsnr%;
        fastcgi_index   index.php;
        include         /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
    }

And add the following lines under the ``include         /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;``

.. code-block:: bash

    include %home%/%user%/conf/web/%domain%/nginx.fastcgi_cache.conf*;
    
    if ($request_uri ~* "/path/with/exceptions/regex/whatever") {
        set $no_cache 1;
    }

***************************************************************
How can I clear the cache?
***************************************************************

When FastCGI cache is enabled an button is added to "Edit" Web where you can clear the cache or use the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    v-purge-nginx-cache user domain.tld

***************************************************************
Why do I don't have the option to use FastCGI cache
***************************************************************

FastCGI cache is an option for Nginx mode only. If you are using Nginx + Apache2 you can enable proxy caching template and proxy cache will enable. Functions almost the same. Proxy cache will also work in case you use a docker image or nodejs.
