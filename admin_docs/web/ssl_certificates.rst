Error: Let's Encrypt validation status 400.
**************************************************

When requesting an SSL certificate the following error is often seen:

Error: Let's Encrypt validation status 400. Details: Unable to update challenge :: authorization must be pending
means

It could mean multiple things:

1. Cloudflare proxy is enabled and SSL is set too strict. 
2. Nginx / Apache2 is not reloading / Issue with an template
3. IPv6 is setup. Disable IPV6 in DNS
4. Wrong / Incorrect template. 

In the future we hope to improve debugging but so far the easiest currently is:

Go to /var/log/hestia/ and when you run the command you will multiple log files:

``LE-{user}-{domain}.log``

Open this log file an go to "Step 5"

You will see something like. 

.. code-block:: bash

    ==[Step 5]==
